##About
A desktop application which will play piano key's sound on every keyboard key (from A to Z) pressed thus making typing a pleasant experience! I have also set songs for the number keys from 1 to 5 which act like a playlist. We can change the songs of the playlist by simply replacing them in the sounds folder and by following the existing naming convention. 

#Steps to run this game:
1.	Make sure you have recent version of Node.js installed
2.	Clone this repository using the web URL of the project
3.	In the terminal, navigate to my_musical_keyboard_using_electron folder
4.	Run command: npm install
5.	Finally, type npm start and hit Enter

Enjoy!!
